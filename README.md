# Honda Cars Application

## Introduction
We are incredibly grateful to Honda Cars India Ltd for giving us an opportunity to work for their prestigious organization. The project in question is intended to be an Android Operating System based application that provides users with a one stop experience for all their needs relating to Honda Automobiles. The application will let the users explore the various offerings by Honda in different segments and will also allow them to experience the cars firsthand while providing up to date information regarding the lineup offered. Existing owners of Honda cars will have the pleasure of locating service stations and booking servicing appointments from the application itself. Prospective buyers can learn more about the product of their choice and obtain information about financing options.
